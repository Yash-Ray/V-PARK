About:
</h3>
<p>
Vehicles are something which will always be on an increase, no matter what. Everything is connected with vehicles. This is also due to the increase in population in today's world. There are 1.9 vehicles(personal) per household in the USA, which is not the most populated nation in the world. So, the condition of the populated countries is unthinkable. It is this problem, that this Application deals with. V-PARK : a smart vehicle parking system, which can allow the user to determine the type of vehicle and allot parking spots on its own. This is an semi-automated system, wherein, the type and number of the vehicle are to be entered by the user, and the rest of the work is being done by this application. This appplication allots parking spots appropriately and sends the excess cars into a waiting spot, meaning, they'll be notified and allotted a spot, once any vehicle vacates.

How to Execute this Application?
</h3>
<p>
The entire application is written in C programming Language. So, any IDE and Terminal which supports C compilers will be able to execute this application.
<h6>For IDEs:</h6>
Clone the Repository onto your system, and execute the <strong>'src.c'</strong> file from your IDE.
<h6>For Terminals (Linux/UBUNTU)</h6>
<ul>
  <li><strong>GCC</strong> - For GCC Compilers, follow these steps:
    <ol><li>Assuming your code is saved as <strong>src.c</strong></li>
      <li>Open Terminal</li>
      <li>Type <strong>gcc -o result src.c</strong> - This will compile the file 'src.c' and the compiled code will be named as 'result'.</li>
      <li>Now type <strong>./result</strong> - This will execute the code compiled in the previous step.</li>
      <li>For more information on how to execute <strong>C</strong> codes on Terminals with GCC Compilers, refer to <a href="http://akira.ruc.dk/~keld/teaching/CAN_e14/Readings/How%20to%20Compile%20and%20Run%20a%20C%20Program%20on%20Ubuntu%20Linux.pdf">this</a></li></ol>
  </li>
  <li><strong>CLANG</strong> - For CLANG Compilers, follow these steps:
    <ol><li>Open Terminal</li>
      <li>Type <strong>clang -o result src.c</strong> - This will compile the file 'src.c' and the compiled code will be named as 'result'</li>
      <li>Now type <strong>./result</strong> - This will execute the code compiled in the previous step.</li>
